# NBA Basketball Hotspot Shot Analyzer
 

## Description

Explore the fascinating world of NBA player shot analysis with our innovative web application! Ever found yourself curious about the specific areas on the basketball court where players like Steph Curry frequently nail their three-pointers? We certainly did, and that curiosity inspired us to combine our passion for basketball with our expertise in data science and software engineering.

Introducing our web application, powered by a robust DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) machine learning model. This algorithm excels at identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes within a dataset, making it perfect for pinpointing shooting hotspots on the basketball court, even amidst noise.

Unlike traditional clustering algorithms, DBSCAN eliminates the need to specify the number of clusters in advance. Instead, it utilizes epsilon (eps) and min_samples parameters to identify clusters based on density, offering flexibility and accuracy in the analysis.

Our application processes a comprehensive dataset comprising millions of entries, meticulously preprocessed through our sophisticated data pipeline. The result is an unparalleled level of precision, allowing users to visualize shooting hotspots with utmost accuracy. So, join us in unraveling the mysteries of NBA player shooting patterns and gain insights into the strategic nuances of the game!
